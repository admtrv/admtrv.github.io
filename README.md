## Personal Website

This is my first experiment in web development, created as a personal portfolio site. The design and structure are inspired by presonal [website](https://www.theorangeduck.com/) of [Daniel Holden](https://github.com/orangeduck), which impressed me with its clean layout and unique **ASCII art animations** for menu items.

Currently, I am focusing on learning building the basic layout. My goal is to eventually replicate similar interactive animations while improving my skills.
